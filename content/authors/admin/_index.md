I'm a science writer and podcaster trying to develop my skills and hone my writerly vibes as a student in the [Science Communication Masters Program](https://scicom.ucsc.edu/) at the University of California, Santa Cruz. I used to study the cell signaling processes that control skin cells' movement (or lack thereof) in the [Liu lab](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/liu/) in the University of Colorado's [Department of Biochemistry](https://www.colorado.edu/biochemistry/); I slithered away from there with my PhD in May of 2021.

While at CU, I hosted and produced [Buffs Talk Science](https://buffstalkscience.com/), a podcast about science from CU Boulder and beyond, and served as editor in chief at the [Science Buffs](https://sciencebuffs.org/tag/graycen-wheeler/) STEM blog. My first internship via UCSC is with the communications team at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory at Stanford.

In my personal life, I'm good at crossword puzzles and tabletop RPGs but bad at roller skating and beekeeping. I like action movies with a lot of feelings in them. I have a cat named Helo Wheeler â€“ a handsome but reserved individual. He does not have a website at this time.
