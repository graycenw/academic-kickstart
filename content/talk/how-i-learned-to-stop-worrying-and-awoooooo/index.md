summary: "A talk about tabletop RPGs and the special privilege of being goofy with a group. Also, this was way before people started howling every day at 8:00 pm; this doesn't have anything to do with that."
abstract: "[Ignite Boulder](https://igniteboulder.com/) is a night of presentations on a variety of topics â€“ with a twist! Each presentation has 20 slides, that automatically advance after 15 seconds. Ignite events happen all over, but Boulder hosts the largest in the world every 2 or 3 months. I was selected to give a talk about my RPG group and the delights of group catharsis, which ended with the >1000-member audience doing an extremely exhilerating group holler."
